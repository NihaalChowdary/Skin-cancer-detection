# SKIN CANCER DETECTION
The "SKIN CANCER DETECTION" project integrates dermatoscopy with advanced neural networks to enhance automated diagnosis of skin conditions. Drawing inspiration from a 1994 study on melanoma-mole differentiation, our project overcomes limitations by utilizing a more diverse dataset and modern deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite technological advancements, the project highlights the critical challenge of a limited supply of high-quality images for training precise diagnostic computer programs in the realm of skin diseases.

### Introduction
Our SKIN CANCER DETECTION project involves integrating dermatoscopy, a technique for detailed skin lesion examination, with advanced neural networks to automate diagnosis. Dermatoscopy offers high-quality images for machine learning training. While a 1994 study used dermatoscopic images for melanoma-mole differentiation, limitations like a small dataset persist. Our project addresses this by expanding with a more diverse dataset and modern deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Despite technological strides, the scarcity of high-quality images for varied skin diseases remains a critical challenge in training computer programs for precise diagnosis using technology and machine learning. Released to address the challenge of limited and homogeneous dermatoscopic image datasets, the HAM10000 ("Human Against Machine with 10000 training images") dataset comprises 10,015 diverse images from varied populations and acquisition modalities. Covering essential diagnostic categories like actinic keratoses, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma, the dataset includes over 50% of lesions confirmed through histopathology. Ground truth for other cases is determined by follow-up examinations, expert consensus, or in-vivo confocal microscopy confirmation. While the test set remains non-public, an evaluation server ensures fair method comparisons using the official test set on the challenge website, fostering standardized assessments in the development of automated pigmented skin lesion diagnosis.
