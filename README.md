SKIN CANCER DETECTION
The "SKIN CANCER DETECTION" project integrates dermatoscopy with advanced neural networks to enhance automated diagnosis of skin conditions. Drawing inspiration from a 1994 study on melanoma-mole differentiation, our project overcomes limitations by utilizing a more diverse dataset and modern deep learning techniques, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Despite technological advancements, the project highlights the critical challenge of a limited supply of high-quality images for training precise diagnostic computer programs in the realm of skin diseases.
